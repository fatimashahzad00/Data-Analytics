As you approach the end of this section, let's take a few moments to review
some key concepts before moving ahead. We saw that the data career
space has experienced amazing growth over the last decade. Future predictions indicate
that this should continue. You also discovered that data skills and
tools are becoming more universal. At the same time, experts foresee a continued specialization
of roles within the different fields. We were introduced to
artificial intelligence and saw how it has become an important
tool for data professionals. While we reflect on the information we've
covered so far, please remember that you're not taking these steps of
personal and professional growth alone. Coming up, we'll take a closer look at
the skills needed by data professionals, and we'll investigate how larger
organizations incorporate data analysis. I'm looking forward to joining
you as we continue your journey. I'll see you in the next video.
