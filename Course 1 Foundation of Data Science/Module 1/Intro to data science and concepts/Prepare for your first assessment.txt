As you know, this program asks you to
complete a graded assessment at the end of each section and course, and now is
the time to prepare for your first one. This assessment will effectively verify
your understanding of key data analytics concepts. It will also help build confidence in
your understanding of data analysis while identifying any areas where
you can continue to improve. Assessments can sometimes
feel overwhelming but approaching them with the strategy
makes them more manageable. Here's a list of tips to set
yourself up for success. Before taking an assessment,
review your notes and the videos, readings and the most recent glossary
to refresh yourself on the content. During the assessment, take your time, review the whole test before
filling in any answers. Then answer the easy questions, skip the ones you don't know
the answer to right away. For multiple choice questions, focus
on eliminating the wrong answers first. Also, it's a good idea to
read each question twice, there are often clues that you
might miss the first time. If you start to feel anxious,
calm yourself with some mental exercises. One way to do that is by completing
a simple math problem in your head or spelling your name backwards, this also
helps you recall information more easily. Before you submit the assessment,
check your work but be confident. Sometimes people change an answer
because it feels wrong but it's actually correct,
your first instinct is often the best one. Finally, remember to trust yourself, often people know a lot more than
they give themselves credit for. Everyone learns at different speeds and
in different ways, but it's important to maintain your momentum. So, take the time you need and
when you feel ready, keep moving ahead. You've got this.
