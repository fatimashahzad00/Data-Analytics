Data discourse over the years
You will encounter the terms “data science” and “data analytics” throughout this program. Although these disciplines can be quite different in their scope, industry professionals often use them interchangeably. It’s important to examine the similarities and differences between data science and data analytics to better understand the data career field and where your skills fit. In this reading, you’ll learn more about data science, data analytics, and how the data profession has evolved over time. 

What is data science vs. data analytics 
Data science is an entire field dedicated to making data more useful. A data scientist is a professional that uses raw data to develop new ways to model data and understand the unknown. Often, their job responsibilities incorporate various components of computer science, predictive analytics, statistics, and machine learning. The collections of information that data scientists work with can be quite large, requiring expertise to organize and navigate. 

Data analytics is a subfield of the larger data science discipline. The aim of data analytics is to create methods to capture, process, and organize data to uncover actionable insights for current problems. Analysts focus on processing the information stored in existing datasets and establishing the best way to present this data. Data analysts rely on statistics and data modeling to solve problems and offer recommendations that can lead to immediate improvements. 

The following table presents a side-by-side comparison:

Data science

Produces broad insights that concentrate on which questions should be asked about data
Confronts what is unknown by using advanced techniques to make predictions about the future 

Data analytics

Emphasizes discovering answers to questions being asked 
Determines actionable insights that can be applied immediately based on existing queries

The connections between data science and data analytics:
Data science and data analytics share a fundamental goal: discover insights that can be used to lead an organization to improve and grow. They are closely connected with information gathered through interactions within the measurable world. As data projects become more complicated, organizations are discovering the advantages of assembling data teams, bringing data analysts and data scientists together. Within these highly-collaborative working environments, data scientists and data analysts work on common tasks using similar software packages, tools, and programming languages. Additionally, the responsibilities of data scientists and data analysts are impacted by a company’s resources, budgetary constraints, and other factors which vary depending on the organization and industry. The commonalities between data science and data analytics within the workplace explain why practitioners and industry professionals often use the two titles interchangeably. This has also extended to job postings. 

The data professional in the data career space
This program uses a few terms when addressing data science and data analytics professionals. The term data professional is used when referring to data scientists and analysts collectively. Data analytics professional is used to highlight positions where the majority of tasks focus on data analytical processes. The data career space functions as an inclusive term referencing the spectrum of jobs and careers in data science and related areas. The intention for these descriptors is to serve as inclusive labels—enabling the broadest possible grouping of data science and data analytics related jobs and titles. 

Career opportunities for data professionals span a wide range of industries. Each with their individualized needs, demands, and responsibilities. It’s possible for two employees with the same job title at two different organizations to have different roles and tasks. To help clarify how careers across data science and data analytics are described in this program, the data career space is used to collectively refer to the variety of careers and job opportunities available to those with data science skills.

The data career space over time
So far, you’ve been considering how data science and data analytics work together in the data career space. This field has also been evolving and changing over time as technology, data storage, data analysis, and communication has changed. Progress in the field means that data professionals need to learn to adapt and evolve to build and define careers within this space—and understanding how the data career space has evolved so far can help you do just that. 

1965
In 1965, the world’s population was 3.3 billion. The Mariner 4 spacecraft took the first close-up pictures of Mars. The first commercial communications satellite allowed nearly instantaneous contact between Europe and North America.

Field
Technology
Summary
Computations were still done by hand; companies were just starting to  invest in new computing technologies to assist analysts. The first desktop programmable calculators replaced room-sized computers. Users could backup complex mathematical operations onto magnetic cards and print the results.

Field
Data storage
Summary
Simple punch cards stored programming information. These cards would be loaded in a specific order to give commands. Businesses allocated physical space to store the thousands of data punch cards regular computer usage would generate. Larger organizations upgraded to magnetic tape reels that could hold the equivalent of 50,000 punch cards, or about 3 megabytes. But these reels still required a lot of storage space within an office.

Field
Data analysis
Summary
As computer technology reduced in size and cost, more companies began to pivot away from doing computation work by hand.

Field
Communication
Summary
Documentation and correspondence were transformed by the electric typewriter.Documents and messages were hand delivered within offices. New telephone systems allowed multiple incoming and outgoing lines, programmable buttons for saving phone numbers and intercom abilities for up to 30 extensions.

1985
In 1985, the world’s population was 4.8 billion. The internet’s domain name system was created. A hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica was discovered. DNA is first used in a criminal case. 

Field
Technology
Summary
Phone lines become the superhighways of communication. By the 1980s, the scanning fax machine became a necessity for businesses, allowing them to quickly send and receive documents. Desktops were now small enough for users to have a personal computer. Windows 1.0 was released.
