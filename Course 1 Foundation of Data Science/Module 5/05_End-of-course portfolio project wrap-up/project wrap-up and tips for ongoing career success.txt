You've completed the first
portfolio project, congrats. Planning and documenting
your approach to the example situation is a useful experience as you begin thinking about your
future job hunt. Soon, you'll be able
to impress hiring managers by discussing your
data professional experience, including understanding
stakeholder requests, establishing a clear and
straightforward project plan, and completing an effective
strategy document. In addition, you'll
understand how to plan out and organize the
necessary workflow. This is a big part of a
data professionals process. Also, as you've learned, it's helpful to
communicate about your transferable skills
with potential employers. The information you've added to your PACE strategy document will be valuable during
job interviews. There will be another
opportunity to complete a portfolio project at the
end of the next course. At that point, you will use the PACE strategy document
that you started here to continue developing your skills as a
data professional. Then at the end of the program, you'll bring everything
together in order to finalize your unique reproach to
this example situation. The goal is to have a great
example of your work that clearly demonstrate your
skills to potential employers. Congratulations again,
and I hope you have a really rewarding
experience as you continue working on your portfolio project throughout this program.
