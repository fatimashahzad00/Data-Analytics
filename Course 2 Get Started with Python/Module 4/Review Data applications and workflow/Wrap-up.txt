You've reached the end of
the data workflow overview. You've covered a lot of material and
concepts. Great job. You saw how the PACE framework
can be used to help structure and guide you through projects. Next, we learned about
effective communication and how it can be used within
the PACE framework. We looked at the external factors that
can have an impact on data analysis. We also looked at the internal factors
that can have an impact on data analysis, like bias within data. As you're preparing for
the weekly challenge, don't forget that you can review
any of the materials we covered. In the next section, you'll begin
working on your first portfolio project. I wish you the best of luck.
