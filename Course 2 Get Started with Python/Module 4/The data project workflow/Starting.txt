We began our journey
into the data professional world by covering the basics of data science, exploring careers, and discussing skills
needed to succeed. In this section,
we'll investigate the workflow within
data-driven careers. You'll be introduced to a
helpful organizational tool called the PACE model, that can provide
structure while allowing great flexibility when
working on projects. We'll explore the elements of
effective communication and some best practices when
sharing your ideas with others. All of these skills and
tools will help you prepare for your upcoming
portfolio project. I know you're
excited to continue. Let's get started.
