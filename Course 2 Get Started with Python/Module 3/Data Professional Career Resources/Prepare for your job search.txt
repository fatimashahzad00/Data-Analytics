Congrats on your progress so far and on taking meaningful action
to advance your career. I wanted to let you know about some of
the great career building activities and resources you will encounter in the rest
of this program in the next course and those that come after it will have
the chance to complete a number of hands on activities based
on data driven scenarios. They'll let you put what you're
learning into practice and help you discuss your skills with
hiring managers in a concrete way. Be sure to save your work
from these activities, they'll be useful to you as you
near the end of the program and start thinking about the next
stage of your data driven career. When you get to the last
course in the program, we'll go in depth on preparing for
a job search. We'll cover how to find and
apply for jobs that interest you. I'll also share some tips to help you
prepare for the interview process, so you'll know what to expect going in,
you'll learn how to put together an online portfolio that will help you demonstrate
your knowledge and experience. You'll also complete a scenario
based project from beginning to end. That you can put in your portfolio and
use to present your working process to potential employers with your past
working and educational experiences, your career journey will be unique to you. But whatever path you
choose the knowledge and resources you gain from this program
will give you a strong start, you've accomplished so much already and
there's so much more to come. Good luck on the next
part of your journey. I'm excited to meet up
with you again soon.
