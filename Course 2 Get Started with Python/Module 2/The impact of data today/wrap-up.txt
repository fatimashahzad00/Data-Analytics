In this section of the course, we explored
many different facets of data careers. You learned that data professional is
a broad term that encompasses different roles and
responsibilities in the data space. You discovered that the work we do in this
field involves countless possibilities, such as determining important data
streams, identifying and focusing on future business goals and reimagining
internal and external processes. You also thought about some of the ways
that organizations are being transformed by data professionals and how these
talented individuals use their skills to positively impact communities
around the world. You've come so far already, but
there's so much more to learn. Thanks for joining me on this
exciting exploration, and I'll catch up with you again soon.
